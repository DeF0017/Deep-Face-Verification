# Deep Face Verification
## Introduction
Deep Face Verification is a deep learning-based project that verifies whether two images are of the same person. This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from facial images and compare them to determine similarity.

## Features
- Face Detection: Automatically detect faces in images using a pre-trained face detector.
- Feature Extraction: Extract features from detected faces using a CNN.
- Face Verification: Compare extracted features to verify if two faces are of the same person.
- Pre-trained Models: Use pre-trained models for quick setup and experimentation.
- Custom Training: Train your own models using custom datasets.

## Installation and Usages
* Cloning the repository:
  ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DeF0017/Deep-Face-Verification.git

## Datasets
This project uses the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset. You can download it from [Here](https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832) paper.
- Thanks to the contributors of the LFW dataset.
